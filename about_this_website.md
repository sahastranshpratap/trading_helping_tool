- **Database**: SQLite (development), easily upgradable to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Styling/UI**: Tailwind CSS, custom components
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **API Communication**: Axios

## How It Works
1. **User registers** with email, username, and password (passwords are hashed).
2. **Login** issues a JWT token, stored in localStorage and sent with every API request.
3. **Trade data** is stored per user; analytics and dashboard only show the logged-in user's data.
4. **Frontend** communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints.
5. **Analytics** are calculated on the backend and sent to the frontend for visualization.
6. **Security**: All sensitive endpoints require a valid JWT token.

---

## Setup & Development
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Backend**:
   - Create a virtual environment and install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
   - Set up `.env` for secrets (JWT secret, etc.)
   - Run the Flask app (`python backend/app.py`)
3. **Frontend**:
   - Install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn`)
   - Start the dev server (`npm start` or `yarn start`)
4. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Extending & Deploying
- **Database**: Swap SQLite for PostgreSQL/MySQL for production.
- **Deployment**: Use Gunicorn/UWSGI + Nginx for backend, Vercel/Netlify for frontend.
- **APIs**: Integrate with broker APIs for auto-importing trades.
- **Analytics**: Add more advanced analytics, AI-based trade review, etc.
